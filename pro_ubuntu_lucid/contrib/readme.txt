#

Here I answer to a few questions that you might have regarding the Pro_Ubuntu_Lucid style.

Q - Why are the buttons available only for languages using Latin alphabet ?
A - The reason is simple : The new Ubuntu font I used for the style is still under development and is available only in Latin alphabet.  And since I speak only French and English and I speak no language that requires a different alphabet, such as Arabic, Russian, Chinese, Japanese or Thai, I cannot use another language than English or French (and barely Spanish) as my system language and for my keyboard settings.  For all these reasons, I cannot make non-Latin translations.

Q - My language uses Latin alphabet, but isn't included within this style.  How can I have it in my language ?
A - I only made the buttons for the most common languages and I based my selection on CyberAlien's localization choices.  And some languages (ex: Lithuanian) have no translated buttons and so, I cannot do the translation.  You can either use the PSD or XCF files and download the font family to do the translation yourself, or do a request. If you choose the second option, don't forget to give the translation for each button.

Q - Why is there no accents in some translated buttons ?
A - Even thought the new Ubuntu font has a much wider language support, there are some accents that I couldn't type, such as the ones with an horizontal bar above the letter, as it isn't included within the list of characters I can type using the Compose key under Ubuntu.

Q - Can I modify this style for my needs ?
A - You can modify it without any problem, whatever the modification degree.  I even included GIMP and Photoshop files to make modifications easier on the graphics side.  But all I ask you is to keep the copyright notice (Pro_ubuntu_Lucid style by Ishimaru Design) if you want support for the style in phpBB communities and on my own board.  However, you can add a "Modified by X" notice just after the copyright notice.

Q - Which softwares did you use to make this style ?
A - As I mostly work under Ubuntu, I work with applications that are shipped with Ubuntu, or are available in the package manager.  I used Inkscape to export .SVG files to .PNG (especially for icons), GIMP to make the buttons and crop the two panels from screenshots I took from my desktop.  And I used gedit to edit the files.
When I have to work under Windows XP, I use GIMP, Inkscape and Notepad++

Q - Did you make all the icons that are used in the buttons ?
A - Some graphics come from my Ubuntu desktop's resources.  The icons that are used for the profile buttons since version 1.2.0 are made by myself with Inkscape.  You can download them at this page : http://ishimaru-design.servhome.org/en/svg-files.php

Q - Why did you provide both PSD and XCF files instead of just providing PSD files ?
A - Since I made my graphics with Gimp, I decided to provide both formats for commodity reasons for GIMP users.  When you use GIMP, it's always recommended to work with the native file, when possible, because the PSD format which is a closed format, isn't fully supported by GIMP.  So, I preferred to provide both formats, so GIMP users can work with the native format while Photoshop users are able to do modifications as well.

Q - Are you going to port this style to other forum platforms ?
A - It's been a long time I'm thinking about it, but I didn,t have much time for it, as I have already many things to do.  But the door isn't closed.

LICENSE AND AUTHOR INFO ABOUT ICONS USED IN PRO_UBUNTU LUCID STYLE

As much as possible, I try to use only open source material, or material made by me for this style.


The following images directly come from my desktop.  Some are directly cropped from a screenshot of my desktop, and others come from Ubuntu Lucid's resources that are located in the system's /usr/share/icons directory.
- The two panels on top and bottom of the pages
- The forum/topic list headers
- The Ubuntu icons used for forums/topics folders
- The header's background image

The font used for the logo and buttons is the new Ubuntu font family, developed by Canonical Ltd.  As I learned that I cannot include the .ttf files within this package for license compatibility reasons, you now have to download them at this link : http://font.ubuntu.com

Since version 1.2.0, all pics used in profile buttons are made by myself and replace the old ones that were incompatible with GPL license.
They are licensed CC-BY and can be downloaded at this link : http://ishimaru-design.servhome.org/en/svg-files.php

The buttons (shape and gradient effects) are made by me using GIMP and materials mentioned above.

The style itself is licensed under GNU GPL v2 license.
